# TT_Download

The scripts are created for the project: Fun with Frustration? TikTok Influencers' Emotional Expression Predicts User Engagement with COVID-19 Vaccination Messages.
We used the package TikTokAPI, an unofficial TikTok API wrapper In Python, to help us download the videos from TikTok. Due to the constant changes within TikTok, some functions might not work from time to time. Please refer to the most updated version of the package and talk with the developer to see how they address the changes accordingly.
The package TikTokAPI github link is here: https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api.
